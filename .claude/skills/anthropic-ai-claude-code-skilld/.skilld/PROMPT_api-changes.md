## Search

Use `skilld search "query" -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code` as your primary research tool — search before manually reading files. Run `skilld search --guide -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code` for full syntax.

## Task

**Find new, deprecated, and renamed APIs from version history.** Focus exclusively on APIs that changed between versions — LLMs trained on older data will use the wrong names, wrong signatures, or non-existent functions.

Find from releases/changelog:
- **New APIs added in recent major/minor versions** that the LLM will not know to use (new functions, composables, components, hooks)
- **Deprecated or removed APIs** that LLMs trained on older data will still use (search for "deprecated", "removed", "renamed")
- **Signature changes** where old code compiles but behaves wrong (changed parameter order, return types, default values)
- **Breaking changes** in recent versions (v2 → v3 migrations, major version bumps)

Search: `skilld search "deprecated" -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `skilld search "breaking" -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `skilld search "v2.1" -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `skilld search "v2.0" -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `skilld search "v1" -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `skilld search "Features" -p @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

**Item scoring** — include only items scoring ≥ 3. Items scoring 0 MUST be excluded:

| Change type | v2.x | v1.x → v2.x migration | Older |
|-------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Silent breakage (compiles, wrong result) | 5 | 4 | 0 |
| Removed/breaking API | 5 | 3 | 0 |
| New API unknown to LLMs | 4 | 1 | 0 |
| Deprecated (still works) | 3 | 1 | 0 |
| Renamed/moved | 3 | 1 | 0 |

The "Older" column means ≤ v0.x — these changes are NOT useful because anyone on v2.x already migrated past them.

## Format

<format-example note="Illustrative structure only — replace placeholder names with real @anthropic-ai/claude-code APIs">
## API Changes

This section documents version-specific API changes — prioritize recent major/minor releases.

- BREAKING: `createClient(url, key)` — v2 changed to `createClient({ url, key })`, old positional args silently ignored [source](./.skilld/releases/v2.0.0.md:L18)

- NEW: `useTemplateRef()` — new in v3.5, replaces `$refs` pattern [source](./.skilld/releases/v3.5.0.md#new-features)

- BREAKING: `db.query()` — returns `{ rows }` not raw array since v4 [source](./.skilld/docs/migration.md:L42:55)

**Also changed:** `defineModel()` stable v3.4 · `onWatcherCleanup()` new v3.5 · `Suspense` stable v3.5
</format-example>

Each item: BREAKING/DEPRECATED/NEW label + API name + what changed + source link. All source links MUST use `./.skilld/` prefix and include a **section anchor** (`#heading-slug`) or **line reference** (`:L<line>` or `:L<start>:<end>`) to pinpoint the exact location (e.g., `[source](./.skilld/releases/v2.0.0.md#breaking-changes)` or `[source](./.skilld/docs/api.md:L127)`). Do NOT use emoji — use plain text markers only.

**Tiered format:** Top-scoring items get full detailed entries. Remaining relevant items go in a compact "**Also changed:**" line at the end — API name + brief label, separated by ` · `. This surfaces more changes without bloating the section.

## Rules

- **API Changes:** 15 detailed items + compact "Also changed" line for remaining, MAX 111 lines
- **Every detailed item MUST have a `[source](./.skilld/...#section)` link** with a section anchor (`#heading-slug`) or line reference (`:L<line>` or `:L<start>:<end>`). If you cannot cite a specific location in a release, changelog entry, or migration doc, do NOT include the item
- **Recency:** Only include changes from the current major version and the previous→current migration. Exclude changes from older major versions entirely — users already migrated past them
- Focus on APIs that CHANGED, not general conventions or gotchas
- New APIs get NEW: prefix, deprecated/breaking get BREAKING: or DEPRECATED: prefix
- **Experimental APIs:** Append `(experimental)` to ALL items for unstable/experimental APIs — every mention, not just the first. MAX 2 experimental items
- **Verify before including:** Cross-reference API names against release notes, changelogs, or docs. Do NOT include APIs you infer from similar packages — only include APIs explicitly named in the references
- **Framework-specific sourcing:** When docs have framework-specific subdirectories (e.g., `vue/`, `react/`), always cite the framework-specific version. Never cite React migration guides as sources in a Vue skill when equivalent Vue docs exist
- **NEVER fetch external URLs.** All information is in the local `./.skilld/` directory. Use Read, Glob, and `skilld search` only.
- **Do NOT use Task tool or spawn subagents.** Work directly.
- **Do NOT re-read files** you have already read in this session.
- **Read `_INDEX.md` first** in docs/issues/releases/discussions — only drill into files that look relevant. Skip stub/placeholder files.
- **Skip files starting with `PROMPT_`** — these are generation prompts, not reference material.
- **Stop exploring once you have enough high-quality items** to fill the budget. Do not read additional files just to be thorough.

## Output

Write your final output to the file `/Users/syn/work/aicmd/.claude/skills/anthropic-ai-claude-code-skilld/.skilld/_API_CHANGES.md` using the Write tool. If Write is denied, output the content as plain text instead — do NOT retry or try alternative paths.

After writing, run `skilld validate /Users/syn/work/aicmd/.claude/skills/anthropic-ai-claude-code-skilld/.skilld/_API_CHANGES.md` and fix any warnings before finishing. If unavailable, use `npx -y skilld validate /Users/syn/work/aicmd/.claude/skills/anthropic-ai-claude-code-skilld/.skilld/_API_CHANGES.md`.

## Reference Priority

| Reference | Path | Score | Use For |
|-----------|------|:-----:|--------|
| Discussions | [`_INDEX.md`](./.skilld/discussions/_INDEX.md) | 5/10 | Only maintainer-confirmed patterns — community workarounds are lower confidence |
| Issues | [`_INDEX.md`](./.skilld/issues/_INDEX.md) | 4/10 | Only workarounds confirmed by maintainers or with broad adoption |
| Releases | [`_INDEX.md`](./.skilld/releases/_INDEX.md) | 3/10 | Only for new patterns introduced in recent versions |

## Task

**Extract non-obvious best practices from the references.** Focus on recommended patterns the LLM wouldn't already know: idiomatic usage, preferred configurations, performance tips, patterns that differ from what a developer would assume. Surface new patterns from recent minor releases that may post-date training data.

Skip: obvious API usage, installation steps, general TypeScript/programming patterns not specific to this package, anything a developer would naturally write without reading the docs. Every item must be specific to @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk — reject general programming advice that applies to any project.

## Format

## Best Practices

- Use @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk's built-in `createX()` helper over manual wiring — handles cleanup and edge cases automatically [source](./.skilld/docs/api.md#createx)

- Pass config through `defineConfig()` — enables type inference and plugin merging [source](./.skilld/docs/config.md:L22)

- Prefer `useComposable()` over direct imports in reactive contexts — ensures proper lifecycle binding [source](./.skilld/docs/composables.md:L85:109)

- Set `retryDelay` to exponential backoff for production resilience — default fixed delay causes thundering herd under load [source](./.skilld/docs/advanced.md#retry-strategies)

```ts
// Only when the pattern cannot be understood from the description alone
const client = createX({ retryDelay: attempt => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attempt, 30000) })
```
```
</format-example>

Each item: markdown list item (-) + @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-specific pattern + why it's preferred + `[source](./.skilld/...#section)` link. **Prefer concise descriptions over inline code** — the source link points the agent to full examples in the docs. Only add a code block when the pattern genuinely cannot be understood from the description alone (e.g., non-obvious syntax, multi-step wiring). Most items should be description + source link only. All source links MUST use `./.skilld/` prefix and include a **section anchor** (`#heading-slug`) or **line reference** (`:L<line>` or `:L<start>:<end>`) to pinpoint the exact location. Do NOT use emoji — use plain text markers only.

## Rules

- **13 best practice items**
- **MAX 213 lines** for best practices section
- **Every item MUST have a `[source](./.skilld/...#section)` link** with a section anchor (`#heading-slug`) or line reference (`:L<line>` or `:L<start>:<end>`). If you cannot cite a specific location in a reference file, do NOT include the item — unsourced items risk hallucination and will be rejected
- **Minimize inline code.** Most items should be description + source link only. The source file contains full examples the agent can read. Only add a code block when the pattern is unintuitable from the description (non-obvious syntax, surprising argument order, multi-step wiring). Aim for at most 1 in 4 items having a code block
- **Verify before including:** Confirm file paths exist via Glob/Read before linking. Confirm functions/composables are real exports in `./.skilld/pkg/` `.d.ts` files before documenting. If you cannot find an export, do NOT include it
- **Source quality:** Issues and discussions are only valid sources if they contain a maintainer response, accepted answer, or confirmed workaround. Do NOT cite bare issue titles, one-line feature requests, or unresolved questions as sources
- **Framework-specific sourcing:** When docs have framework-specific subdirectories (e.g., `vue/`, `react/`), always prefer the framework-specific version over shared or other-framework docs. Never cite React examples in a Vue skill
- **Diversity:** Cover at least 3 distinct areas of the library. Count items per feature — if any single feature exceeds 40% of items, replace the excess with items from underrepresented areas
- **Experimental APIs:** Mark unstable/experimental features with `(experimental)` in the description. **MAX 1 experimental item** — prioritize stable, production-ready patterns that most users need
- **NEVER fetch external URLs.** All information is in the local `./.skilld/` directory. Use Read, Glob, and `skilld search` only.
- **Do NOT use Task tool or spawn subagents.** Work directly.
- **Do NOT re-read files** you have already read in this session.
- **Read `_INDEX.md` first** in docs/issues/releases/discussions — only drill into files that look relevant. Skip stub/placeholder files.
- **Skip files starting with `PROMPT_`** — these are generation prompts, not reference material.
- **Stop exploring once you have enough high-quality items** to fill the budget. Do not read additional files just to be thorough.
- **To verify API exports:** Read the `.d.ts` file directly (see Types row in references). Package directories are often gitignored — if you search `pkg/`, pass `no_ignore: true` to avoid silent empty results.

## Output

Write your final output to the file `/Users/syn/work/aicmd/.claude/skills/anthropic-ai-claude-agent-sdk-skilld/.skilld/_BEST_PRACTICES.md` using the Write tool. If Write is denied, output the content as plain text instead — do NOT retry or try alternative paths.

After writing, run `skilld validate /Users/syn/work/aicmd/.claude/skills/anthropic-ai-claude-agent-sdk-skilld/.skilld/_BEST_PRACTICES.md` and fix any warnings before finishing. If unavailable, use `npx -y skilld validate /Users/syn/work/aicmd/.claude/skills/anthropic-ai-claude-agent-sdk-skilld/.skilld/_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.
